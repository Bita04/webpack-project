# Webpack Project

A custom JavaScript project built with **Webpack** to handle modular code, optimize assets, and improve the development workflow.


## Package Management

This project uses:
* `package.json` → To define all dependencies and npm scripts.
* `package-lock.json` → To ensure consistent installs across different machines by locking dependency versions.
  

## Features

* **Custom Webpack Configuration** (`webpack.config.js`) for flexible setup.
* **CSS, SCSS, and Image Loaders** → Added loaders to handle styles and image imports.
* **Babel Integration** → Ensures compatibility across different browsers and environments.
* **Webpack Dev Server** → Live reloading during development without manual restarts.
* **File Hashing** → Adds unique hash codes to file names for better cache management.
* **HTML Webpack Plugin** → Automatically injects bundled files into HTML.
* **Mode Separation** → Configured different modes (`development` / `production`) to test performance and loading speeds.
